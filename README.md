## Task 1

### Task description

Implement a function caching_fibonacci that creates and uses a cache to store and reuse previously calculated Fibonacci numbers.

Requirements:

1. The function caching_fibonacci() must return an inner function fibonacci(n).
2. The inner function fibonacci(n) should compute the n-th Fibonacci number.
3. If the number is already in the cache, the function should return the cached value.
4. If the number is not in the cache, the function should compute it, store it in the cache, and then return the result.
5. Use recursion to calculate Fibonacci numbers.

### Execution

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the task_1 folder:

```
cd task_1
```

3. Run the script using Python:

```
python main.py
```

4. The program will execute and display the results directly in the terminal.
